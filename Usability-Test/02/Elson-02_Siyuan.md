|**1**                    | **First Impression**  |
|                         | Took some time to understand the various graph representation |
|**2**                    | **Observation** |
| General                 | NA |
| Total Volume Panel      | No need Total Calls, prefers just Total Vessels will do |
|                         | Hover for exact volume is useful for reports |
|                         | Green, blue lines useful for planning |
|                         | BTR, ETB helps understand if there are overflows to the next day. Ideally these 2 lines should be close to one another |
|                         | Previously, Peak factor is manually calculated, it is a lot better with the peak factor values just calculated. |
|                         | Peak factor not too useful for planning |
| BOA                     | Clear to user if BOA is high or low at first glance |
|                         | Good to have send email function for BOA graph and non-BOA vessels to planners, can be use it for reports to their superiors for activity forecast. |
|                         | Would like to see waiting time of a list of vessels from all terminals (from highest to lowest, top few will do) |
|                         | For reports, actual waiting time is required |
|                         | Plan waiting time is more important for planners as they can still improve on it |
|                         | Lesser steps required to filter via terminals compared to the existing BPMS |
|                         | 7D, 1M view is good. The dates plotted for 7D is good |
|                         | 3 month view not neccessary to user |
| Shipping Lines BOA      | Good to have if able to select a few lines for comparison (e.g. Japanese lines NYK, MOL, K line, so able to take note of vessel not BOA) (to find out their vessel which are not BOA) |
|                         | No need for threshold as it is subjective for various lines |
|                         | Good to have to incldue the actual values of BOA of the lines (e.g. 8 BOA, out of 9 vessels = 88%) |
|                         | Feeders, smaller shipping lines not critical to show |
|                         | Show Lines that contribute to the highest volume |
| Alliance                | Users know that the numbers are low, planners will have to zoom into that alliance and check for vessels that are not BOA |
|                         | Good to have waiting time and those vessels that are not BOA shown upon hover to lines |
| Volume Terminal         | Useful for superiors, not for planners. Unless instructed to target at specific terminals/vessels |
| Mega Vessel By Terminal | Mega vessel by terminal is useful for reports |
|                         | If sees red values, terminals will adjust resources based on demand |
|                         | Current colours is ok |
|                         | Suggests to show the number of mega berths beside the terminal names |
|                         | 1D view not needed as it can be found in the 7D view also as 7D view table can look for only a day. |
|                         | Good to have hover with vessel indicating Gross Berth Profit (GBP) beside the vessel list.|
|                         | Good to have inclusion of marine information like on time pilots. |
|**3**                      | **Closing** |
| | The order of the panels are rightly prioritised |
|Like Most | BOA shipping lines, helps with planning  |
| | BOA graphs is good as well, helps to zoom into which terminal needs to more BOA |
|Like Least | Volume panel can show exact values of the individual BOA values at the top of the dot. |
| | Would be good to have break down of C1-C5 |
|**4**   | **Question** |
| | Can have another panel to show the waiting time. |
