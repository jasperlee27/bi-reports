|**1**                    | **First Impression**  |
|                         | Spotted the personal profile at the top right, might be some login feature |
|                         | Saw the graph but the ETB and BTR lines are not obvious, took some time before realising the lines below ETB and BTR represent in the graph. User looked at legend and thought that it was related to the legend. |
|**2**                    | **Observation** |
| General                 | All 1M view should show the current month with 1st and 31st dates shown |
| Total Volume Panel      | ST cap might change every month. Suggests to put the red line on the 100k mark, no need to show under legend |
|                         | Hover for exact values is good |
|                         | 1M view should plot everyday (1st to 31st of the month) |
|                         | 3M view is not needed |
|                         | Total Vessel and Total Call should be renamed to only Total Vessel Call |
| BOA                     | 3M not needed (Good to have) |
|                         | 1M view should plot everyday (1st to 31st of the month) |
|                         | Hover for exact values is good |
| Shipping Lines BOA      | Top 10, 20 would be better. Search feature is good |
|                         | Date range is good and clear. |
|                         | Default view shows 1 week, start from Monday (business week) |
|                         | Less than 5% shows red would be better |
| Alliance                | NA |
| Volume Terminal         | 7D - default should be shown by business week |
| Mega Vessel By Terminal | The colors represent various values which are fixed. However, the amt of mega vessel that the terminal can support is subjective. KT, BT max 2 |
|                         | Prefers without any colours |
|**3**                      | **Closing** |
| | The order of the panels are rightly prioritised |
|Like Most | Everything. It is better than the existing system  |
|Like Least |  ETB and BTR from Total volume panel, it was not clear  |
| | Would be good to have break down of C1-C5 |
|**4**   | **Question** |
| | NA |
