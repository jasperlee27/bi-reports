|**1**                    | **First Impression**  |
|                         | Commented that it has the same look and feel as the BPMS berth chart |
|                         | |
|**2**                    | **Observation** |
| General                 | Noticed the date picker for total volume |
|                         | Commented the peak factor is good. |
|                         | Concern about export/mail functions. Use e-mail most of the time. Print seldom. Save as file is obsolete. |
| Total Volume Panel      | Clicked the date picker and played around with dates |
|                         | Don't want the date range to automatically change to business week. Prefer a current date + 6 view. |
|                         | Noted that should not be actual value, rather forecasted volume. |
|                         | Wants 2 trend, 1 trendline to calculate volume by ETB(What we can give) and another by BTR (What customers apply for)|
|                         | Do not really need a target volume, more of our terminals max volume of 105k/day. |
|                         | Average containers handled per day is good indicator. |
|                         | To know customer volume demand (by BTR) as it shows our actual business i.e pure customer volume without IGF/ITF |
|                         | Calculation of volume by ETB includes IGF/ITF |
|                         | Average volume is important, target volume is not. |
|                         | Peak factor calculated for week lookahed is enough. |
|                         | Weekly volume estimated 670k. |
| Volume By Terminal      | Do not need ATB, just follow ETB or BTR |
|                          | By ETB is forecasted volume handled per day. By BTR is customer demand. |
| Mega Vessel By Terminal  | Did not really dwell on it. Did not make much comments. |
| BOA                      | Not important to have 3 months view. Just 1 month will do.|
|                          | BOA is important and comparison by showing 2 graphs function is good (Selecting Terminals) |
|                          | Default launch shows business week. If not all date selections should be current + 6 |
|                          | Want the mouseover to show exactly value, but have concerns about exporting format. |
|                          | Made request for BOA % by lines (across ALL terminals) |
|                          | Made request for BOA % by alliance too (3 Main: OA/2M/THE) |
|                          | Important to have customer BOA (Last+This+Next Week). Maybe monthly too. |
|                          | Wait time is equally important as BOA |
|                          | BOA to include JV (More holistic) and exclusing JV (for reporting to MOT) |
|                         | |
|**3**                      | **Closing** |
| | - |
|Like Most | Less clustered and figures very clear & clean. Especially flexibility of selection and good to have customer BOA  |
|Like Least |  Positioning of BOA. Should be pushed higher in dashboard. |
|                         | |
|**4**   | **Question** |
| | NA |
