| Javern                 | First Impression  |

|                         | Looks like BPMS chart |
|                         | **Observation** |
| General                 | Usually generating a report on a week's of report |
| Total Volume Panel      | A week view is very good |
|                         | Preferred Graph should show 7 days from the date user selected |
|                         | Peak factor is good |
|                         | Target volume can omit, not very helpful as they usually have a target volume in mind when they are looking at the graph (107k TEU per day, this is the target) |
|                         | Average line is good useful from the 7D shown |
|                         | Should include forecast volume also |
|                         | Forecast and Actual volume should be clear and concise |
|                         | By ETB, BTR graph |
|                         | Customer volume demand (KPI) good to have |
|                         | Monthly view, target and peak lines not needed |
|                         | Average line should come with a display of the value at the side |
| Volume By Terminal      | Default view should show current business week |
|                          | Ability to customise view based on to and from date selection from user is good to have. Date + 6 days |
| Mega Vessel By Terminal  | ATB not needed |
|                          | Customer Volume Demand (BTR) and Forecasted volume per day (ETB) |
| BOA                      | Default view should show 7D view |
|                          | Preferably show the values of the BOA of that week |
|                          | No need for 3M view |
|                          | Monthly view should be 1-31st of the month |
|                          | Good to have if Volume and BOA panel can be seen in first glance |
|                          | Good to have if exporting of reports to .pdf or .xls |
|                          | Good to have values viewable upon hover |
|                          | Good to have if all of the hover info can be exported as well |
|                          | Good to add ST1, ST2 values into all the graph |
|                          | (Alliance - OA, 2M, THE) for weekly view (This week, last week, next week) |
|                          | Wait time and BOA is equally important, if there is no BOA, wait time needs to be displayed. Wait time can be displayed when hover. |
|                          | **Closing** |
| | Volume view is very important as overview |
| | Most Like: Less cluttered, less numbers and figures compared to current system.  |
| | Most Dislike: Position of BOA panel should be at the top.  |
| | **Question** |
| | NA |
