| **1**                   | First Impression  |
|                       | Simple to read and understand. Similar features from the existing system. |
| **2**                 | **Observation** |
| General               | Usually for activity forecast it will be generating report in weekly basis.|
| Total Volume Panel    | The average volume data is not needed.  |
|                       | Monthly view is good  |
|                       | Prefers user select specific date, the graph should show data starting from the user selected data with the next 6 days  |
|                       | Good to have a more detailed graph view if user wants to choose to and from specific date  |
|                       | Peak factor is good. The top-right position is good too  |
| Volume By Terminal    | Existing system does not have such view, it only shows the volume as a whole of PSA.  |
|                       | Good to have as it shows how the volume gets splits into terminals  |
| Mega Vessel By Terminal  | Existing system also have this, but shows in a day view |
|                          | Per terminal per day view also alright |
|                          | Weekly view for terminals to see into which day of the week will be busy, to shift their resources to that day |
|                          | RESD might find this panel useful |
|                          | Monthly view hardly useful (Good to have) |
|                          | Prefers daily view in 7 days |
|                          | Good to have total number of vessel per week/day |
|                          | Good to have non-mega vessel view as well |
| BOA                      | BOA panel is really useful |
|                          | Consider include wait time (number of hours the ships have to wait) (atb - atr). To show how long the ships have to wait |
|                          | 1 month view is useful |
|                          | Existing system no quarterly view |
|                          | Good to have year to day view |
|                          | Date selected + 6 days should be shown when in 7D view |
|                          | Month view should be showing month to date (30 dates in graph) |
|                          | Consider inclusive or exclusive of JV, for BOA and wait time that needs inclusion and exclusion of JV |
|                          | Hover for specific values at date points is important for all of the graphs |
| **3**                    | **Closing** |
| | The layout of the panels should be Total volume > BOA > Vol By Terminal > Mega Vessel by Terminal |
| | Typical user looks for overview of Volume first, followed by BOA, how we are serving our customers. And look into volumes by terminal |
| | If this system is out, it will be able to cut down on a lot of tedious manual work process to generate the report. Estimated half a day per week is saved |
| | This is very clear visualisation of the report |
| Like Most | Simple to read and understand, but confusing on the selection of date. |
| Like Least | NA
| **4**                    | **Question** |
