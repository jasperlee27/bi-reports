|**1**                    | **First Impression**  |
|                         | Noticed the date picker for the total container volume and peak factor on the dashboard. Started to click the date picker. |
|                         | |
|**2**                    | **Observation** |
| General                 | Commended the peak factor. |
|                         | Noted that should have a total number of vessels+calls e.g 420/week |
| Total Volume Panel      | Clicked the date picker and played around with dates 19 & 22, unsure of how the date range is generated |
|                         | Prefer a current date + 6 view. To select business week, just click Monday |
|                         | Currently do not report average, only target and actual. Believe average is good. |
|                         | Monthly and quarterly view may be good for bosses|
|                         | Date range of +/- 3 days is not as good |
|                         | Peak factor displayed top right is good (together with legend) |
| Volume By Terminal      | Week and date range should be similar |
|                          | Break down by terminals is good for reporting volume, good to split by ST too. |
| Mega Vessel By Terminal  | Noticed mega vessels but not a good breakdown. |
|                          | Prefer per day per terminal. |
|                          | Noted that monthly and quarterly not critical, rarely used, for info only.  |
|                          | Mega vessels per day per terminal is used for planning resources. |
| BOA                      | BOA date range follows volume, should be selected day + 6|
|                          | Monthly view should follow calendar month |
|                          | No need for 3M view, current report do not have that. |
|                          | Noted that planned wait time and actual wait time is important, would like to have it incorporated. |
|                          | Wait time: Number of hours we have to delay the vessel, i.e ATB-BTR |
|                          | Incoming vessels to use ETB as not yet ATB |
|                          | Actual & Planned wait time is an indicator to measure customer satisfaction |
|                          | Custom selection panel is useful, drill down by terminal to check |
|                          | BOA to include JV (More holistic) and exclusing JV (for reporting to MOT) |
|                         | |
|**3**                      | **Closing** |
| | The order of priority should be total volume to show general outlook. Followed by BOA which shows how I am serving my customers and then the subsequent 2 panels for more details. |
| | If we were to use this, it will help cut down tedious processes of generation of lookahead and Activity Forecast every Friday and Tuesday. |
| | Estimated time saved would be half a day per week. |
| | Clear visualisation of data e.g exact value is important (Upon hover) |
|Like Most | Simple to read and understand  |
|Like Least |  Abit confusing on the selection of dates. (Time window generated) |
|                         | |
|**4**   | **Question** |
| | NA |
